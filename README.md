# Adrian's Personal Website

This is the repository where I host my personal website from. This website was built using the Strata template by HTML5 UP. Feel free to use this code for your own website!

A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of my
personal site. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.

you can use for pretty much whatever.
