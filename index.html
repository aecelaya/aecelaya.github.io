											Accurate medical imaging segmentation is crucial for effective medical interventions, but convolutional neural 
											networks (CNNs) still struggle with fine-scale features and image scale variations, particularly in complex tasks 
											like the BraTS brain tumor segmentation challenge. To address these challenges, we propose two architectures, 
											FMG-Net and W-Net, that incorporate geometric multigrid principles into CNNs. Our experiments on the BraTS 2020 
											dataset show that FMG-Net and W-Net outperform the commonly used U-Net in tumor subcomponent segmentation accuracy 
											and training efficiency. The figure above shows sketches of the U-Net, FMG-Net, and W-Net architectures 
											for different network detphs. More details and results are available

											<!-- Accurate medical imaging segmentation is critical for precise and effective medical interventions. However, 
											despite the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image segmentation, they still face 
											challenges in handling fine-scale features and variations in image scales. These challenges are particularly 
											evident in complex and challenging segmentation tasks, such as the BraTS multi-label brain tumor segmentation 
											challenge. In this task, accurately segmenting the various tumor sub-components, which vary significantly in 
											size and shape, remains a significant challenge, with even state-of-the-art methods producing substantial 
											errors. Therefore, we propose two architectures, FMG-Net and W-Net, that incorporate the principles of 
											geometric multigrid methods for solving linear systems of equations into CNNs to address these challenges. 
											Our experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrate that both FMG-Net and W-Net outperform the widely 
											used U-Net architecture regarding tumor subcomponent segmentation accuracy and training efficiency. 
											These findings highlight the potential of incorporating the principles of multigrid methods into CNNs to 
											improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical imaging segmentation. More details and results are available

									<h4>Weighted Normalized Boundary Loss</h4>
									<article>
										<p>
											The Weighted Normalized Boundary Loss (WNBL) is a boundary-based loss for minimizing the Hausdorff distance for deep
											learning-based medical imaging segmentation. This novel loss function has more desirable numerical properties than 
											current methods and weighting terms for class imbalance. The WNBL outperforms other losses when tested on 
											the BraTS dataset using a standard 3D U-Net and the state-of-the-art nnUNet architecture.
											<br>
											<br>
											The WNBL is given below:
											\begin{align*}
												\mathcal{L}_{wnbl} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{C} w_k \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left(D_{i}^{k}\left((1 - T_{i}^{k})^2 - P_{i}^{k}\right)\right)^2}{\sum_{k = 1}^{C} w_k \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left(D_{i}^{k}\left((1 - T_{i}^{k})^2 - T_{i}^{k}\right)\right)^2},											
											\end{align*}
											where $N$ denotes the total number of pixels (or voxels in the 3D case), $C$ denotes the number of segmentation classes, 
											$P_i^k \in [0, 1]$ is the $i$-th voxel in the $k$-th class of the predicted mask, $T_i^k \in \{0, 1\}$ is the $i$-th 
											voxel in the $k$-th class for the ground truth, and $D_i^k \in \mathbb{R}$ is the $i$-th voxel for the $k$-th class in 
											the ground truth distance transform map. More details and results are available 
											<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

												The automatic segmentation of medical images aims to associate a pixel to a label
												within a medical image without human interaction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
												and deep learning have helped facilitate enormous strides in the efficacy of automatic
												segmentation for medical imaging over the last several years. However, modern
												deep learning paradigms for 3D medical image segmentation are computationally expensive,
												often requiring high-end computing resources and several days of training time on those
												resources. My research explores ways to reduce this computational cost while also preserving
												segmentation accuracy. By exploiting similarities between CNNs and numerical discretizations
												for solving partial differential equations, we can create neural networks capable of achieving
												comparable segmentation accuracy to conventional CNNs while requiring substantially fewer
												parameters. The figure above highlights the results of our model for the task of labeling a
												brain tumor (shown in red). These results are available

									<h4>Deep Learning-Based Inversion of Surface Gravity For CO$_2$ Monitoring</h4>

											CO$_2$ geological storage is a carbon capture and storage technology that captures CO$_2$ emissions from fixed 
											sources like power plants and stores it in underground saline formations, making it a practical and near-term 
											solution. However, long-term monitoring is necessary to ensure volume storage integrity. 4D gravity monitoring 
											is an effective low-cost and environmentally friendly technique for monitoring geological storage sites. To 
											predict subsurface CO$_2$ plumes, a deep learning approach was developed that outperforms traditional 
											inversion methods, producing high-resolution 3D subsurface reconstructions in near real-time. The figure above 
											highlights the results of two of our proposed approaches. More details and results can be found 
											<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.										
											<!-- One carbon capture and storage technology currently deployed worldwide is CO$_2$ geological storage. 
											The technology involves separating and capturing CO$_2$ emitted from large-scale fixed sources, such as 
											cement, petrochemical, or coal-fired power plants, and storing it in underground saline formations. It holds 
											promise as one of the most practical, immediate-effect, and near-term technologies. However, ongoing monitoring 
											of these geological storage sites is mandated by regulatory authorities and will need to demonstrate volume 
											storage integrity over long periods. A passive measure of density distribution changes in the subsurface, 4D 
											gravity monitoring is a technique of interest as it is low-cost, rapid, and has a minimal environmental impact.

											<br><br>We developed a deep learning approach to invert simulated gravity data to 3D subsurface rock/flow 
											properties. The target application of this algorithm is the prediction of subsurface CO$_2$ plumes as a 
											complementary tool for monitoring CO$_2$ sequestration deployments. Our proposed approaches outperform 
											traditional inversion methods and produce high-resolution, 3D subsurface reconstructions in near real-time. The 
											figure above highlights the results of two of our proposed approaches. More details and results can be found
